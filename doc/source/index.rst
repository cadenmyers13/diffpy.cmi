``diffpy.cmi`` - Complex modeling infrastructure: a modular framework for multi-modal modeling of scientific data.

DiffPy.CMI is our complex modeling framework. It is a highly flexible library of Python modules for robust modeling of nanostructures in crystals, nanomaterials, and amorphous materials.

The software provides functionality for storage and manipulation of structure data and calculation of structure-based quantities, such as PDF, SAS, bond valence sums, atom overlaps, bond lengths, and coordinations. Most importantly the diffpy.cmi package contains a fitting framework for combining multiple experimental inputs in a single optimization problem.
